How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Showed the line numbers.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Abilitiy to back up to previous builds that worked correctly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits could lose crucial progress if not made frequently enough;
    automatic commits could have too many versions to look through for a
    specific commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different file structure or storgae mechanisms.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows commit logs to show notes on specific commits while git diff
    will compare commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Ability to create different versions to venture down different paths to
    see which one suits the situation the best without losing the original
    build.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Recording all work in order to showcase progress.
