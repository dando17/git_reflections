How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You can block logical changes by the task or improvement that they
	achieve.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	the branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
